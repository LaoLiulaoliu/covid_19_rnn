### covid 19 LSTM predict

covid 19 around the world have new deathes everyday.
Based on the data provided by a student, I did:

 1. kmeans
 2. neural network to simulate linear regression
 3. LSTM to predict

Found:

 1. GDP is relate to morbidity and death.
 2. The rank of data matrix r < n, have countless solutions. Linear Function can not converge, can not be used to forecast.
 3. The data lack Epidemiological(流行病学) parameters. Infection probability(传染概率), Infection coefficient(传染系数), latent rate(潜伏率), exit rate(退出率).
